# Energy Consumption Prediction 🔋📊

This project predicts energy consumption using machine learning. It leverages historical data, weather conditions, and other factors to provide insights for better energy management in smart buildings.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess energy data.
- 🤖 **ML Models**: Train models like Linear Regression & Decision Trees.
- 📈 **Evaluation**: Measure performance with RMSE, MAE, and R².
- 🎨 **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize energy usage.
- 🚀 **Flask API**: Serve the trained model for predictions.

## 🔧 Technologies

- 🐍 **Python**
- 🚀 **Flask** (Web Framework)
- 📊 **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- 🔢 **Numpy** (Numerical Operations)
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- 🎨 **Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
- 🌈 **Seaborn** (Statistical Plots)
